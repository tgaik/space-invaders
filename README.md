# Space Invaders (Pygame)

A classic-style Space Invaders game developed using Python and Pygame. This project demonstrates foundational Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, clean modular design, and game development techniques. It is ideal for beginners exploring game design and Python programming.

## Summary

My first project ever!

A 2D arcade shooter game like Galaga where the player controls a spaceship that fires bullets to destroy approaching enemy ships. The game includes dynamic difficulty scaling and score tracking.

**Key Computer Science Concepts:**

- **OOP Principles:** Use of classes for entities like `Player`, `Enemy`, `Bullet`, and `EnemyShip`
- **Encapsulation and Modularity:** Game logic is separated into multiple Python files for maintainability
- **Collision Detection:** Custom implementation of collision logic between bullets and enemies
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Player input handled via Pygame event queue
- **Game Loop Design:** Real-time updates, rendering, and logic execution in a consistent frame loop
